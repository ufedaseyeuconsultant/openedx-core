    Decision 4 resolves which profile (or override) applies at four specific write events
    (creation, a more specific profile appearing later, an author setting a per-criterion
    override, and an override being cleared back to matching the computed profile), and stores
    the result. ``rule_profile`` is null only when an author has set a per-criterion override; in
    every other case it holds the id of the profile that was resolved at the relevant write event
    and is never re-resolved dynamically. Do not add a property, manager method, or other helper
    that recomputes it; that would contradict the ADR.

    When ``rule_type_override`` is set, its ``rule_payload_override``'s shape (see
